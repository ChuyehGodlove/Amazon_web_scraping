# Amazon_web_scraping
In this project i used the various python libraries such as 
  pandas
  Beautiful soup etc. 
to scrape data about sales concerning a t-shirt .
i also went futher to laod the data into an excel file, already transformed into csv before uploading.
The main objective of this project was to be able to not only get data for a foxed period of time but also to be able to 
obtain upto date/current data. that is i should be able to notice any changes in the data at any time.
